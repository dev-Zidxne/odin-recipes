<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>    4 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs</li>
<li>    2 Teaspoon Jamaican Curry Powder, for Seasoning</li>
<li>    2 Teaspoons Curry Powder, for Cooking</li>
<li>    ½ Teaspoon Smoked Paprika</li>
<li>    1 Teaspoon Pink Himalayan Salt</li>
<li>    ½ Teaspoon Black Pepper</li>
<li>    ½ Scotch Bonnet Pepper</li>
<li>    2 Small Potatoes, Diced</li>
<li>    1 Medium Carrot, Peeled and Sliced</li>
<li>    6 Pimento Balls</li>
<li>    3 Garlic Cloves, Minced</li>
<li>    1 Small Onion, Peeled and Slices</li>
<li>    2 Tablespoon Vegetable Oil</li>
<li>    ½ Lemon or Lime</li>
<li>    1 Cup Water, For Cooking</li>
<li>    Water, for Cleaning</li>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>    Start by cutting any excess fat from chicken thighs and cut into ½ inch strips.</li>
    <li>    Equipment Needed: A sharp knife and a cutting board.</li>
    <li>    Clean chicken by adding cut chicken to a bowl and squeezing the juice of half of a lemon and cover with water.</li>
    <li>    Drain and wash with clean water before draining.</li>
    <li>    The Chicken Thighs should have a slight smell of citrus; Drain any excess water to ensure seasonings will stick to the chicken.</li>
    <li>    Season chicken by adding ½ teaspoon of curry powder, paprika, black pepper, salt, sliced onions and scotch bonnet. Using a large spoon, or a gloved hand, massage the spices into the chicken then allow to sit and marinate at room temperature until ready to cook.</li>
    <li>    Using a large and thick skillet, heat vegetable oil on medium heat. Once heated, add the 2nd ½ tablespoons of curry powder and minced garlic. Cook for about 30 seconds to a minute until curry slightly changes in color and fragrant.</li>
    <li>    Once curry becomes slightly caramelized, begin adding chicken pieces. Ensure each chicken piece is flat so allow an even cook and color. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side.</li>
    <li>    Once flipped, add potatoes, onions, carrots, thyme and stir until vegetables are coated in spices. Add 1 Cup of water and stir. Cover and cook on medium heat until potatoes are soft and tender, about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally to keep an eye on the pot.</li>
    <li>    The potatoes will aid in creating a thick sauce, you may mash some potatoes to create a thicker sauce.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
